# Unsloth Fine-tuning on Google Colab

This repository demonstrates efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Unsloth library within the Google Colab environment. It leverages techniques like LoRA and QLoRA to minimize memory footprint and training time, while supporting a wide range of LLMs including Llama-3 8b, Mistral, CodeLlama, and others.

## Technical Implementation

* **Unsloth Integration:** The core functionality relies on Unsloth, which provides optimized implementations for LLM training and inference.
* **LoRA/QLoRA Adapters:** Fine-tuning is achieved through the application of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) or Quantized LoRA (QLoRA) adapters, allowing for efficient parameter updates without modifying the base LLM weights.
* **RoPE Scaling:** Unsloth automatically handles Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) scaling, enabling flexible sequence length adjustments.
* **4-bit Quantization:** Supports loading pre-quantized models in 4-bit format, significantly reducing memory requirements and download times.
* **Hugging Face TRL:** Employs Hugging Face's Transformers Reinforcement Learning (TRL) library, specifically the `SFTTrainer`, for streamlined supervised fine-tuning.
* **Hardware Acceleration:** Leverages hardware capabilities like FP16 and BF16 for optimized performance on different GPU architectures.
* **Gradient Checkpointing:** Utilizes gradient checkpointing techniques, including Unsloth's optimized implementation, to further reduce memory consumption during training.

## Advanced Features

* **Custom Data Handling:** The notebook provides a framework for loading and preprocessing datasets, including an example using the Alpaca dataset. Users can readily adapt this for their own data sources.
* **Model Saving and Loading:** Supports saving the fine-tuned model in various formats:
    * LoRA adapters for efficient storage and sharing.
    * Merged float16 or 4-bit formats for direct use with inference engines.
    * GGUF format for compatibility with llama.cpp and other tools.
* **Inference Optimization:**  Unsloth enables native 2x faster inference for the fine-tuned models.
* **Text Streaming:** Allows for continuous token-by-token generation using the `TextStreamer` class, providing a more interactive user experience.

## Optimization Strategies

* **Batch Size and Gradient Accumulation:** The training configuration is designed to balance batch size and gradient accumulation steps for optimal resource utilization.
* **Learning Rate Scheduling:** Employs a linear learning rate scheduler to facilitate convergence during fine-tuning.
* **Weight Decay:** Applies weight decay to regularize the model and prevent overfitting.

## Technical Requirements

* Google Colab environment with GPU access.
* Required libraries are installed within the notebook using `pip`.
* Familiarity with Python, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers is recommended.
